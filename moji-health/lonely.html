        <h4>Why am I feeling lonely?</h4>

        <p>Loneliness is a common emotion among people nowadays and can be caused by
            a variety of reasons. Most commonly though, people feel lonely because 
            they feel like no one is supporting them, or they have no one to talk to.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other reasons why people feel lonely is technology, not fitting in, and taking huge responsibilities on their
            own. Technology can cause you to feel disconnected from your friends and family. As humans, we crave 
            relationships, and sometimes technology doesn't help in deep relationship building. You can also feel lonely
            if you don't exactly fit in to your friend group, school, etc. If you have different ideas or interests than
            the people you are close with, you can feel a little lonely. When we take on huge responsibilities on our own 
            like taking care of disabled family members or even taking on a high position at work, we can sometimes feel 
            alone as not many people can relate to us. 
            
          </p>

          <p>
           Lastly, it's important to note that you can feel lonely even when you have friends and family you talk to. Often times, 
           loneliness isn't caused by a lack of friends, but a lack of belonging or lack of deep relationships.

        <h4> How can I stop feeling lonely?</h4>

        <p>Loneliness can be caused by a culmination of factors and sometimes is a state of mind, so it 
            may take some time for you to get rid of the feeling completely. That being said, here are some tips you can follow that 
            may help you.
        </p>

        <h5>1. Watch something funny</h5>
        <p> 
           Though watching something isn't going to help you make deep relationships or help you fit in, it can help 
           release dopamine in your brain, making you happy and uplifting your mood. However, this shouldn't be your go to 
           thing to do when you are lonely, because watching tv all the time can make you even more lonely.
        </p>

        <h5>2. Talk to people about your feelings</h5>

        <p>Sometimes when we keep our feelings bottled up, the build up of emotions without a healthy release 
            can cause us to feel alone. This is why it's important to talk to others about how you feel. We recommend you 
            to start small. Start by saying 'hi' to your neighbors. Then slowly go into talking to them about how the weather 
            makes you feel, or how Sunday night's football game made you feel. 
        </p>

    <div class="three">
        As you reach out to others, remember to listen to 
        them too. Later, try to branch out and invite them over to your house or plan a trip with them. Of course, you can do this 
        with an old friend, family member, or even a colleague. By venting out your feelings to someone, you'll feel more 
        supported and so less lonely.

        <h5>2. Get a pet</h5>

        <p>If you feel alone because you live alone, then getting a pet is a really good option. In addition to not being 
            alone at home, owning a pet can give you some new responsibilities. These responsibilities can help you be busy 
            and thus make you less lonely. Having a pet is like having a new family member, so that can also help you 
            feel less lonely.
        </p>

        <h5>3. Join a club or volunteer</h5>

        <p>If you feel lonely because you don't fit in or you feel isolated from others, joining a club or volunteering is a really 
            good option for you. If you don't fit in with your current friends, then branch out and meet new people. You never know, 
            you can meet someone with the same interests as you! If you feel isolated from others, then joining a club or volunteering 
            will help you create a sense of community and belonging with the people you work with. Working with others towards your interests, 
            or the interests of the community is such a bonding activity.
