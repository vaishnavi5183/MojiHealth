          <h4>Why am I feeling guilty?</h4>

          <p>It's perfectly ok to feel guilty, and in fact shows that you are 
              an empathetic person who's aware of the consequences of your 
              actions. 
          </p>

          <p></p>
              
              If you don't know why you are feeling guilty, we recommend
              you to relax for a bit first. Then, take out a piece of paper and
              think about your actions that stand out to you, whether it was in the past
              or not. Once you list out your actions, try to circle the ones that
              make you feel guilty.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ok, now that you know why exactly you are feeling guilty, let's move on to analyzing
              what you can do to make yourself feel better!

          <h4> How can I stop feeling guilty</h4>

          <h5>1. Don't blame yourself too much</h5>
          <p> 
              Often when we are guilty, we think about what we did too much. It's ok 
              to feel bad and blame yourself for a while, but too much could be bad. When 
              you blame yourself a lot, you can lose confidence and lose your ability to fix 
              the problem. To make yourself feel better, we recommend you to make a plan to fix it.
              For example, if you're feeling guilty because you broke your diet or because you wasted time on social
              media, forgive yourself, and make a plan to not do that the consequent day.
          </p>

          <h5>2. Stop making yourself the bad person</h5>

          <p>When we are guilty of something, like breaking a diet, we start telling ourselves that we are 
              'bad'. For example, a person who breaks their diet may tell themselves that they 
              have no self-control. Unfortunately, when you make yourself to be a bad person, you start closing off channels for 
              self improvement. For example, if you believe you have no self control, you're probably going to break your diet again.
          </p>

         
      </div>

      <div class="three">
        <h5>3. One bad action doesn't define you</h5>

        <p>While it's true that you are responsible for your actions, it's also true that one action 
            shouldn't define who you are. Now, this doesn't mean you should ignore what you did, but instead 
            of feeling bad about yourself, feel bad about your actions. 
        </p>

        <h5>4. Be self-compassionate</h5>

        <p>When trying not to feel guilty, people think they need self-confidence. But they don't. The most
            important thing you could do is to forgive yourself and tell yourself that it's ok to make mistakes. 
            When you forgive yourself and become more self-compassionate, you will automatically be more self-confident.
        </p>

        <h5>5. Try to solve the problem</h5>

        <p>When feeling guilty, it's important that you try to solve the problem to make yourself feel better. So, if you hurt someone, 
            apologize. If you broke your diet, make plans to stick to it next time. It's also important to note that
            when you apologize to someone, you apologize for what they think you did wrong, not what you think 
            you did wrong.
